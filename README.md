<h2>DeltaOne Stock Tracking & Accounts System</h2>

I built this system as my A-Level computing coursework (on which I received a grade of A). The system was built for a real client, Delta One Contractors, a new company that was starting up in my hometown: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The system has the following features:
 - Keep track of the financial account balance.
 - Recording payroll of employees.
 - Keeping track of stock of items, specifically the different kind marble tiles that the company sells.
 - Allow clients to sign in and make orders of marble tiles.
 - Record sales of marble tiles, which would automatically deduct the number of tiles from the available stock. This includes adding the profit from the sale to the current account balance.
 - Record purchases of marble tiles from suppliers. Once confirmed, the amount would be added to the available stock. This includes deducting the cost of the purchase from the available balance.
 - Allow suppliers to sign into the system and update order status (Out of Stock or Shipped). 
 - Give users certain access rights into certain parts of the system.

The company no longer uses the system due to domain-related problems, but I can upload the website on a hosting service on request.
